# Kinematics and Dynamics of UR10 in Gazebo

This project uses inverse kinematics and Euler-Lagrange equations to simulate the kinematics and dynamics of a UR10 robot from Universal Robotics.

## 1. Trajectory Control

In the first part, the manipulator is given a trajectory to follow. It is calculating the joint angles to create that trajectory using inverse kinematics.
